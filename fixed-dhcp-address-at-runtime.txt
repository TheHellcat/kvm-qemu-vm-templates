About adding additional fixed DHCP IP addresses for VMs during runtime:

The problem:
If you add additional <host> entries to the vnet definition via 'virsh net-edit vmnetname', the virtual network needs to be restarted (i.e. 'virsh net-destroy' and 'virsh net-start') for the new entries to be picked up and used.
BUT: restarting the virtual network like this makes ALL VMs using it to loose their network connectivity until being fully shutdown/powered off and restarted themselfs.

Usually not what we want.

The solution:
We can add a new host entry to the currently active network by putting only the <host> node into a seperate XML file:

<host mac='ca:ca:ca:03:01:01' name='lab1' ip='192.168.241.203'/>

And then add it via:

virsh net-update vmnetworkname add ip-dhcp-host hostentry.xml
(change "vmnetworkname" to match your setup, ofc.)

HOWEVER: this now only applies to the currently running network and is lost upon restarting it.

SO: to have it both ways, "now" and "forever", just do both. "virsh net-edit" for the permanent definition and "virsh net-update" to apply it to the currently running instance.

Yay :-)
